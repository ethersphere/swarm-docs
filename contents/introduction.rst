Swarm is a censorship resistant, permissionless, decentrelised storage- and communication infrastructure.

This base-layer infrastructure provides these services by contributing resources to each other. These contributions are accurately accounted for on a peer to peer basis, allowing nodes to trade resource for resource, but offering monetary compensation to nodes consuming less than they serve.

Swarm is using existing Smart-Contract platforms (e.g. Ethereum) to implement the financial incentivisation.

The Ethereum Foundation operates a Swarm testnet that can be used to test out functionality in a similar manner to the Ethereum testnetwork.
Everyone can join the network by running the Swarm client.

Development status
==================

Uploaded content is **not guaranteed to persist on the testnet** until storage insurance is implemented (see `Roadmap <https://github.com/orgs/ethersphere/projects/8>`_ for more details). All participating nodes should consider participation a voluntary service with no formal obligation whatsoever and should be expected to delete content at their will. Therefore, users should **under no circumstances regard Swarm as safe storage** until the incentive system is functional.
